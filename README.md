# shadow-os
A custom OS fully written in Rust
---
##Introduction
This will essentially be an operating system written in Rust. It will be designed to explore low-level programming and hardware interaction, and to be independent of larger systems. It will feature a minimal kernel and basic input/output. The project's main focus is learning and experimentation, and there are plans to add more advanced features in the future. I also hope to add a custom desktop environment.
