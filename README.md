# Shadow-OS
A custom OS fully written in Rust

## Introduction
This is an operating system written in Rust. It is designed to explore low-level programming and hardware interaction, and to be independent of larger systems. It features a minimal kernel and basic input/output. The project's main focus is learning and experimentation, with plans to add more advanced features in the future. A custom desktop environment may be added later.
